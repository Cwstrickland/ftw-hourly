                  <p>The dictionary definition for Jaeger is hunter or huntsman. This is a person who hunts game, or searches for something. In the business world, the equivalent would be the sales staff of a company. At The Jaeger Co, a Jaeger is one of our sales professionals who hunt opportunities for a contracting business. Does this describe you? Are you a sales expert that is ready to take control of your hunt?

                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “How does this all work?” First, you will want to setup your profile to effectively demonstrate your skillsets as a Jaeger to any clients. Think of this as your elevator pitch. Next, businesses will reach out on opportunities based on your skills. Now you will have the chance to negotiate a mutually beneficial project scope with your client. Once a deal has been reached, it’s show time. Now, release the hounds, you are on the hunt. Once you are successful in your hunt, it’s time to reap your rewards, and enjoy your spoils. It’s that simple.

                        <p><b>Our format has 3 primary benefits for you:</b></p>
                        <ol>
                           <li><b>Career Freedom</b> - Work as often, for your agreed upon pay, and for whom you want. You have the ability to write your own career narrative, free from bosses and HR. Your career is in your hands.</li>
                           <li><b> Diversification of opportunities</b> - You now have the ability to diversify your sales opportunities by contracting with multiple companies, and even multiple industries, thus effectively shielding your personal revenue from risks, or downturns. There no longer needs to be a slow season for your commissions. Set yourself up with gigs to strategically pay you all year.</li>
                           <li><b>New sales opportunities previously unavailable</b> – By contracting with small to medium sized businesses, there are exponentially more sales opportunities than traditional corporate sales roles. These businesses may not be able to hire a fulltime salesman for a number of reasons, but there are sales opportunities to be had, and now you have a method of connecting with those opportunities.</li>
